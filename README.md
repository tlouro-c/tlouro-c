<!-- About Me Section -->
<h2>About Me 💡</h2>
<li><p>I'm currently focused on getting a strong background in Computer Science by finishing 42 Common Core and then specializing in Full Stack Development. I believe in continuous learning to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p> </li>
<li><p>I thrive on challenges, seeing them not as obstacles but as opportunities to break my limits every day. I've embraced the philosophy that things worth achieving don't come easy or fast. The value lies in the journey, the struggle, and the commitment to pushing boundaries.</p> </li>

<h2>Curiosity ❓</h2>
<li><p>Beyond coding and continuous learning, I find joy in investing in my personal growth and exploring diverse realms of knowledge. Health optimization particularly intrigues me, and I actively engage in sports to stay physically active and energized. 🏃🏽‍♂️</p></li>

<h2>Projects 🗂️</h2>
<ol>
    <li><a href="Link"><strong>Pipex</strong></a>: This project at 42 was a favorite. I learned what are processes and how to communicate between them using pipes.
     The challenge was to emulate the functionality of pipes in Bash, redirecting the output of one command to serve as the input for the next.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tlouro-c/fdf.git"><strong>FdF</strong></a>: In this project, I delved into the world of graphics programming. The task involved creating an Isometric projection of a dynamically provided map as an argument.</li>
  <h3>Currently Working on...</h3>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tlouro-c/minishell.git"><strong>Minishell</strong></a>: In this project, our challenge is to replicate Bash functionalities by constructing a shell entirely from scratch using the C language.</li>
